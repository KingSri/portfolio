My process was to first sketch out my wireframes, ie how I wanted the site to look. I wanted to keep it simple, yet visually pleasing.

Following this, I then started to work on backend, switching to front end. It took me many iterations, but eventually I settled on a design similar to one of my more recent projects, Dekigoto. MaterializeCSS was used heavily for the aesthetic appeal, as I had experience using it previously.

While not earthshattering, I learned more about box modeling and how to manipulate it.


## Wins/Unsolved problems/future features:

#### Wins:
- Aesthetically pleasing website with functional mailing function, proper links, and embedded resume

#### Unsolved problems:
- One issue to be fixed in next version update, is the creation of already seeded data into deployment. For the sake of meeting deadlines, I had to hardcode my data onto the page itself, whereas before it took the data from a database.
- I need to properly configure my .gitignore and requirements.txt files to get rid of extra files during committing.

#### Future features:
- Add a sorting method to projects to view by project parameters (ie date, name, etc.)
- Implement fancier front end scripts and styling for visually appealing and enhanced user interface
