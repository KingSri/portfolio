            Utilizing Javascript and HTML/CSS (primarily Bootstrap) to create a working blackjack game. Javascript was utilized for most of the application, primarily to create and shuffle the deck of cards, implement functions based on player input, and increment a counter.
            Players have the option to stand, bet or fold their cards, with computer action based off of player action. Once a player hits zero, the game is over.

          <p>A joint venture with fellow classmate Monica Tadeo, this project sought to combine front end technologies with backend technologies,
            Express and MongoDB to store data. Front end utilizes HTML, CSS (using Bootstrap), and Javascript was used as the primary language to create routes and offer website functionality. The project's theme was based on the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic,
            with the site focus being on creating a web application that could help users create a wishlist for
            hot commodities such as toilet paper and hand sanitizer.</p>

          <p class="white-text">My final project for the SEI-09 Software Engineering Immersive taken at General Assembly-San Francisco, the goal of this project was to become more familiar with django and front end work, such as HTML and CSS.
            The project allows a user to create and upload an event with the option to add a date, upload an image, and like or dislike existing events.
            Users experience customized layouts once logged in and can also leave comments/view existing comments from other users.
            Primarily, the project used the django framework and python as a base, owing to its ease in user authentication, a core feature of this project. jQuery was utilized to increment and manipulate the like feature and to add comments.
